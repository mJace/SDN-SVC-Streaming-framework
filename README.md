# SDN SVC streaming framework.

This SDN SVC streaming framework is based on Dr. Chih-Heng Ke's myEvalSVC-Mininet. [[1]]  
I modified the streamer and receiver to let SVC streaming send packets on 3 UDP ports (total 3 layers of SVC stream). By doing so, SDN controller can setup flow tables for each layer of SVC stream (based on different ports) and separate their routing path for better transmission quality.

The basic work flow of this SDN SVC streaming testing framework is to encoded the video into a 3-layer h264-svc video. Then, stream this SVC via 3 UDP ports to client in mininet environment. After the streaming finished, decode the h264-svc back to yuv and compare with source yuv video by PSNR value.

## Requirement
1. JSVM installed. (Compiling may fail on new version of gcc, Ver4.1 works fine)
2. SVEF [[2]] installed.
3. Replace /src/streamer.c and /src/receiver.c of SVEF by the file of this Repo.
4. Download myfixyuv.c for fixing the distorted video.
5. Download the testing raw YUV video, i.e. foreman_cif.yuv [[3]].
6. Mininet installed.

## Using this framework
1. Prepare the network topology with 1 host as a streamer and another host as the client, with mininet connect with both to simulate the network topology.
2. Prepare the temporal encoding/decoding configuration file.

##### temporal_main.cfg
	OutputFile       temporal.264
	FrameRate      30.0
	FramesToBeEncoded 300
	GOPSize           4
	BaseLayerMode      2
	IntraPeriod      4
	 
	SearchMode    4
	SeachRange    32
	NumLayers      1
	LayerCfg  temporal_layer0.cfg

##### temporal_layer0.cfg
	InputFile  foreman_cif.yuv
	SourceWidth   352
	SourceHeight  288
	FrameRateIn   30
	FrameRateOut        30

### 3. Encoding

```
./H264AVCEncoderLibTestStatic -pf temporal_main.cfg > temporal_encoding.txt
```

### 4. Decode the temporal.264 record the decoding process into temporal_originaldecoderoutput.txt. We need some information from it.
```
./H264AVCDecoderLibTestStatic temporal.264 temporal.yuv > temporal_originaldecoderoutput.txt
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image003.jpg)

### 5. Use the JSVM BitStreamExtractor to generate the original NALU trace file (temporal_originaltrace.txt)
```
./BitStreamExtractorStatic -pt temporal_originaltrace.txt temporal.264
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image006.jpg)

### 6.   Use f-nstamp to add the frame-number in temporal_originaltrace.txt. (It will generate temporal_originaltrace-frameno.txt)
```
mytools/svef-1.5/f-nstamp temporal_originaldecoderoutput.txt temporal_originaltrace.txt > temporal_originaltrace-frameno.txt
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image007.jpg)

### 7.  Setup the network topology using Mininet and create h1 as the server and h2 as the client.
The topology may be vary to each one's experimental requirement. you have to create your own one.

### 8. On the client termianl (h2)
```
sudo ./receiver 4455 myout.264 15000 > myreceivedtrace.txt
```


### 9. On the server terminal. (h1)
```
sudo ./streamer temporal_originaltrace-frameno.txt 30 10.0.0.2 4455 temporal.264 1 > mysent.txt
```

### 10. Once the streamming finished, let nalufilter discard the late frames and disordered frames.
```
mytools/svef-1.5/nalufilter temporal_originaltrace-frameno.txt myreceivedtrace.txt 5000 30 > filteredtrace.txt
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image014.jpg)

### 11. The current version of JSVM cannot decode video streams affected by out of order, corrupted, or missing NALUs. Therefore, SVEF uses filtered packet trace file to extract the corresponding packets in original h.264 video file by means of BitStreamExtractorStatic. (You can think that processed video file corresponds to the actually useful data received at the receiving side.)
```
./BitStreamExtractorStatic temporal.264 temporal-filtered.264 -et filteredtrace.txt
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image018.jpg)  
Result...  
![Alt text](/docs/images/image020.jpg)

### 12. Decode the temporal-filtered.264 into yuv file.
```
./H264AVCDecoderLibTestStatic temporal-filtered.264 temporal-filtered.yuv
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image026.jpg)

### 13. We need the same number of video frames when we want to calculate the PSNR of original YUV and receiving YUV file. So we need to conceal the missing frames by copying the previous frame.
```
./myfixyuv filteredtrace.txt cif 300 temporal-filtered.yuv myfix.yuv
```
![Alt text](/docs/images/image027.jpg)

### 14. Now we can compute the PSNR
```
./PSNRStatic 352 288 foreman_cif.yuv myfix.yuv > result_psnr
```
